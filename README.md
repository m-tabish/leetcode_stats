# stats_leetcode  

A small project created by myself as I move forward to become a Front-end Web Developer. *stats_leetcode* is a webpage which shows you the number of total, easy, medium and hard questions done by any user just by entering their username. 



## API Reference

 
  GET `https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com/${username}`



## Notes
At the time of pushing this repo, the webpage shows my data only, I will try to add an input box where you can enter any username to see its corresponding data soon but cannot promise it. Feel free to contribute I will definitely try to review the PR and merge. Till then, Peace.
